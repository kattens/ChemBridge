        "### **Why did we decide to remove the '-' from the target names?**\n",
        "1. **Removing the Dash (`-`) Broadens the Search Scope**:\n",
        "   - Correct: Removing the dash makes the query less strict, allowing UniProt to search for terms independently rather than as a single specific entity.\n",
        "   - With the dash, UniProt interprets the query as a combined condition (`DRD1 - dopamine receptor D1`), which might not match any entry directly or narrows the search results significantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Dashes in Names Indicate Context, Not the Full Name**:\n",
        "   - Partially correct: While the dash *can* separate parts of the query (e.g., gene name vs. organism name), its meaning is dependent on the context. For example:\n",
        "     - `\"DRD1 - dopamine receptor D1 (human)\"` might be interpreted as looking for a human protein explicitly labeled in that format.\n",
        "     - Without the dash (`DRD1 dopamine receptor D1`), UniProt searches for \"DRD1\" and \"dopamine receptor D1\" more freely, increasing potential matches.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Why Removing the Dash Expands Results**:\n",
        "   - UniProt's search treats the dash (`-`) as part of the query, which could limit results to exact matches with the dash present. When you remove the dash, the system searches for terms individually, yielding broader matches.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Refined Explanation**\n",
        "- If the dash exists in your query (`DRD1 - dopamine receptor D1`), UniProt interprets it as a specific, tightly coupled phrase. This might not yield results unless an entry explicitly matches this exact structure.\n",
        "- Without the dash (`DRD1 dopamine receptor D1`), UniProt treats the terms as separate keywords and attempts to find matches containing any or all of them. This is why removing the dash often yields broader and more relevant results.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Source**\n",
        "\n",
        "The behavior you've observed when searching UniProt with and without a dash (`-`) in your query stems from how UniProt's search engine interprets special characters and query syntax. While UniProt's documentation doesn't explicitly detail the impact of dashes in search queries, we can infer the following based on general search engine behaviors and available information:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. Special Characters in Search Queries:**\n",
        "- Search engines often treat special characters like dashes as operators or delimiters. In some contexts, a dash can signify exclusion (e.g., `term1 -term2` searches for entries containing \"term1\" but not \"term2\"). However, without explicit documentation from UniProt on this behavior, it's unclear how a dash is processed in your specific query.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Broadening Search Results:**\n",
        "- Removing the dash from your query (`DRD1 dopamine receptor D1`) allows the search engine to interpret the terms more flexibly, potentially returning a broader set of results. This approach aligns with general search practices where simplifying queries can yield more comprehensive results.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Organism Specification:**\n",
        "- Including terms like \"human\" in your query helps specify the organism of interest. UniProt entries often include the organism name, so adding this term can refine your search to entries related to human proteins.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Recommendations:**\n",
        "- **Simplify Queries:** Use straightforward terms without special characters unless you're certain of their function in the search syntax.\n",
        "- **Specify Organism:** Include the organism name (e.g., \"human\") to narrow down results to the species of interest.\n",
        "- **Consult Documentation:** For complex queries, refer to UniProt's [Advanced Search Help](https://www.uniprot.org/help/advanced_search) for guidance on query syntax and field-specific searches.\n",
